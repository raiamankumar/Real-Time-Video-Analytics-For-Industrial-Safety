Introduction
Real-Time Video Analytics for Industrial Safety leverages computer vision and artificial intelligence to monitor industrial environments. This project aims to detect and mitigate potential hazards in real time, ensuring worker safety and operational efficiency.

Key Objectives:
Enhance workplace safety by identifying risks such as spills, unsafe equipment handling, or lack of personal protective equipment (PPE).
Provide actionable insights using advanced video analytics.
Enable real-time alerts for timely intervention.
Features
Real-Time Hazard Detection: Identifies unsafe behavior and conditions like no helmet, slippery floors, or fire.
Actionable Alerts: Sends notifications to operators and managers.
Scalable Architecture: Handles multiple video streams simultaneously.
Reports and Analytics: Logs events and generates safety compliance reports.
Integration Ready: Compatible with existing Industrial IoT (IIoT) systems.
Technology Stack
Programming Languages: Python, JavaScript
Frameworks:
Backend: Flask/Django
Frontend: React.js
AI/ML Models: TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV
Databases: PostgreSQL, MongoDB
Streaming Services: Kafka, WebRTC
Deployment: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS/GCP/Azure
System Architecture
Input: Real-time video streams from industrial cameras.
Processing:
Preprocessing video frames.
Running AI/ML models for detection.
Alert Mechanism: Generating notifications.
Output: Visual dashboards and logs for analysis.
